I am a computer science student who is highly intrested in cybersecurity, machine learning, data science, software engineering, competitive programming, 3d design, ect. I am also a aspiring polymath, and proud philomath who uses meta learning, and what I call eclectic learning to eventually become highly knowledgable and profficinet in all of my desired fields. For ex. you could refer to cybersecurity as my main and a pentester being my job. The languages I learn during sofware engineering will allow me to become highly efficient at scripting, and creating tools as well analyzing code. As I build my skill on competitve programming this will help tremendously as well. While mixing and matching a broad base of knowledge to add on top of, I make use of meta-learning frequently keeping up with all the most studied, and well tested, and sometimes bleeding edge techniques for more efficient learning in order to reach my goals as soon as possible.
