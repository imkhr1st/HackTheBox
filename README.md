# HTB Manifesto Until Omniscient

- Check `ranks` for my rank progression and daily box progress.
- Check `acc` for a screenshot of my account at every rank.
- Check `seasons` for my season-by-season progress until reaching HOLO.
- Check `academy` for my daily academy modules, followed by a Quizlet set for that module and a link to my Evernote notes on it!
- Check `info.md` for my socials, other interesting repos, tools when I make them, and my blog over on Hashnode!

I am a computer science student highly interested in cybersecurity, machine learning, data science, software engineering, competitive programming, 3D design, etc. I am also an aspiring polymath and proud philomath who uses meta-learning and eclectic learning to eventually become highly knowledgeable and proficient in all of my desired fields. For example, you could refer to cybersecurity as my main, and a pentester being my job. The languages I learn during software engineering will allow me to become highly efficient at scripting, creating tools, and analyzing code. As I build my skill on competitive programming, this will help tremendously as well. While mixing and matching a broad base of knowledge to add on top of, I make use of meta-learning frequently, keeping up with all the most studied, well-tested, and sometimes bleeding-edge techniques for more efficient learning to reach my goals as soon as possible.
